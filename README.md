# Primorial-Approach-for-Generating-Primes
Generating primes quickly of a given bit size has important applications in multiple fields. For example, RSA, the first public-key cryptosystem, generates 4000-bit primes to secure your data. There are multiple algorithms that rely on generating a random prime within a given bit length and then testing for primality with a strong pseudo-primality test. Currently, this algorithm is characterized by being inconsistent in the time it takes to compute. Our goal was to create a computationally consistent algorithm that could be used to find large prime numbers. Our algorithm was found to be 91% faster than the standard method when generating primes up to 730 bits with our Primorial Approach.
